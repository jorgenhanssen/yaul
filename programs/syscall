// Syscalls has the following signature:
// sys <destination> <syscall_number> <arg1> <arg2> <arg3> <arg4> <arg5> <arg6>
// the returned value from the syscall is stored in the destination register
// Note that syscalls are platform-specific, so the syscall number for the target platform must be used.

// This is a syscall example for Mac x86_64
// ref: https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1504.3.12/bsd/kern/syscalls.master

// Get PID into register 0
sys 0 '20'
out 0

// Modulo the PID by 10
mod 0 '10' 0

// Exit with the result as the exit code
sys 0 '1' 0

// Run 'echo $?' to see the exit code after running this program
