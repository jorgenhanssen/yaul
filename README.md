# YAUL - Yet Another Useless Language

YAUL is an interpreted language with similar-ish syntax to assembly (yayyy...)

## Disclaimer

This repository is nothing more than me messing around. Don't take it seriously, and avoid using it for anything that could be taken otherwise.

## Set up

You will have to have [go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## How to use

Maybe - a beautiful day - I will write how to use the language. For now look at the existing programs.

## Running existing programs

### programs/array

A program that let's the user define an array and enter indices to see what is in the array.

- Enter a length of the array (`N`)
- For `N` iterations (`i`) enter the value at the `i`th index
- For the rest of the program enter an index (0 < `N`) - the program will print the value at the index

### programs/binarysearch

A program that uses the binary search algorithm to find a number.

- Enter a number (`N`)
- Enter the number to find
- The program "simulates" binarysearch to find the number

### programs/count

A program that counts from 0 up to a given number.

- Enter a number (`N`)
- The program counts from 0 up to `N`

### programs/prime

A program to check if a number is prime.

- Enter a number (`N`)
- The program will print 1 if the number is prime and 0 if not.
