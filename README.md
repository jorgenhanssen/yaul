# YAUL - Yet Another Useless Language

YAUL is an interpreted language with similar-ish syntax to assembly (yayyy...)

## Disclaimer

This repository is nothing more than me messing around. Don't take it seriously, and avoid using it for anything that could be taken otherwise.

## Set up

You will have to have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Syntax

Maybe - a beautiful day - I will write how to use the language. For now look at the existing programs.

## Running existing programs

`cargo run <path_to_program>`
